            Guests are issued an RFID tag, which can be used at terminals throughout the event.
            Tags are tied to guests by a web API, while raspberry pis with touchscreens and RFID sensors allow interaction.
            The terminals run a pygame application and can allow sign-in, direct guests to seats, and track engagement.
